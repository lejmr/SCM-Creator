# SCM-Creator

Fork of http://projects.andriylesyuk.com/projects/scm-creator which seems to be dead

Simple Subversion, Git, Mercurial, Bazaar and Github repository creation plugin for Redmine. With this plugin repository creation and registration becomes very easy and needs just one click (or even no click).


The plugin adds “Create new repository” button to the repository addition form (Project → Settings → Repository → Subversion/Git/Mercurial/Bazaar/Github). With just one click on this button a user can create local repository and register it in Redmine/ChiliProject. The plugin also allows to create repository automatically on project registration.

Github SCM is another SCM type, that comes with SCM Creator (not available in pure Redmine).
